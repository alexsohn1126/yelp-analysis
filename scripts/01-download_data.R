#### Download Data ####

# Due to the 30 second limit that Yelp gives to its dataset download links,
# You must download the dataset manually.

# Instrucitons (From this repo's README.md):
# Visit https://www.yelp.com/dataset (Last accessed: 2024 April 15), then click "Download Dataset",
# fill out the personal information, and download the JSON (NOT the photos).
# Extract and place the files in `data/raw_data` folder (there should be `PLACE_EXTRACTED_YELP_DATASET_HERE` file there).
# There will be multiple JSONs, put all of them in `data/raw_data` folder.
